/*
	problem 232
	Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
	push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
	pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
	peek() -- Get the front element.
	empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
	Notes:
	You must use only standard operations of a stack --
	which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size,
	and is empty operations are valid.
	Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively.
	You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue),
	as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
	You may assume that all operations are valid (for example,
	no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
