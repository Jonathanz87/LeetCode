	problem 275
	from problem 274 HIndex
	Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
	write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
	According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
	"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
	and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
	For example,
		given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5],
		which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and
		each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
		Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and
		the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
	Note: If there are several possible values for h,
	the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

	from 275
	Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order?
	Could you optimize your algorithm?
