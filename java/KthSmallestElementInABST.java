/*
	problem 230
	Given a binary search tree,
	write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
	Note:
	You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
	Follow up:
	What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often
	and you need to find the kth smallest frequently?
	How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
