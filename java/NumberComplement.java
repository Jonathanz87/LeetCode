	problem 476
	Given a positive integer,
	output its complement number.
	The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
	Note:
	The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
	You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
	Example 1:
		Input: 5
		Output: 2
		Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
		and its complement is 010.
		So you need to output 2.
	Example 2:
		Input: 1
		Output: 0
		Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits),
		and its complement is 0.
		So you need to o
